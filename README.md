# Resume Work
 Collection of important projects that I have made during my time at Mississippi State
    
    PA1 and PA2 are programming assignments from my Computer Networking class that required us to code UNIX sockets to send a file across a simulated network.

    The AI final project was for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence class for this assignmet we were allowed to choose any type of AI and make a presentation of our findings and some photos of a sample run of our program. What I elected to do was to solve mazes and I went in with just that idea and began exploring the options that already existed and settled on modifying user GKHayes' Markov Decision Process(MDP) to suit my needs and work within the bounds that I wanted to operate in. The result of this was the ability to create plans that would tell the computer the most optimal move from each location in the maze. I tested it on both a small maze and a larger maze and it prints out the correct move for each space given enought iterations.

    Clash Of The Centuries was a 2D tower defence game that me and a group created in Unity over the span of one and a half weeks. At the end of which we were supposed to turn in whatever we had done and to stop working on it. This project was a demonstration on why you must start small when designing a game and not try to plan these huge ideas. The game itself lacks animations and most sound effects because as a group we decided to save those until the end and as we were all students we had other things to do and were unable to add those in. However, we did manage the core gameplay loop and the score/money system working as well as multiple types of enemies.

    Game Jam was a game that only I made in less than 24 hours. It ws not for an official game jam, but one specific for our class. The theme we were given was For The Children and my game is a simple clicker game in which the player clicks a button and gains resources and spends those resources to purchase upgrades. This was also made in Unity and the main feature that I added was a little music player that allowed the player to select the music they wanted to listen to, from a set of preselected tracks.
